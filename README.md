# Swiftly
## About

Swiftly is a simple, small footprint, MVC-esque framework designed for quickly
prototyping small sites or systems. By no means is it a fully featured
framework, and anyone looking to build anything of any serious complexity or
scope should probably stop reading here and find a more appropriate tool.

Swiftly originally started life as a learning project in the summer of 2019, but
has since quickly grown into the mini framework that exists today. Swiftly is
not suitable for production environments. It lacks any real security or advanced
features and isn't even guaranteed to work in most cases. However, if you just
need a scaffold against which to quickly throw together a prototype, Swiftly
might just be the no-nonsense framework you're after!
